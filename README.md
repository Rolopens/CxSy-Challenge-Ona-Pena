### Setup and Assumptions

The complex system was setup using NetLogo. The system contains 50 agents that start at any random pool. The pools are represented by the color of the patches in Netlogo. Pink patches represent the high pool wherein agents in this pool have a 25% chance to earn up to 80$ split among all the agents found in that pool and have 75% chance to earn nothing per round. Blue patches represent the stable pool wherein agents always earn 1$ each per round. Lastly, the green patches represent the low pool wherein agents in this pool have a 50% chance to earn 40$ evenly split among all the agents in that pool and a 50% chance to earn nothing per round. 

### Strategy

The strategy  implemented was a basic strategy of determining whether agents playing aggressive after a certain period of time would yield interesting or noteworthy results such. Several factors contribute as to why this strategy was used. Such factors include the idea of waiting to save costs since there is a tau (cost) when transferring pools. The strategy was then further tested by changing when the agents start changing pools. The test consists of allowing agents to join every 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 rounds. Then, the experiment further tested the strategy by changing the value of tau from values in between 0 to 1 inclusive to see the behavior of the model.
